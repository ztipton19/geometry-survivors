# Clone Protocol

A neon-flavored top-down survival prototype inspired by arena shooters. The player starts with a mining laser that locks onto nearby enemies, ramps damage over time, and swaps targets as threats are eliminated.

## Run

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m main
```

## Controls

- Move: WASD or arrow keys
- Restart after win/lose: `R`
- Toggle debug overlay: `F3` (tune movement/combat params live)
- Quit: `Esc`

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- pygame (see `requirements.txt`)
